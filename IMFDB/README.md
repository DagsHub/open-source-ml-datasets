**Description**:
The Indian Movie Face database (IMFDB) is a large unconstrained face database consisting of 34512 images of 100 Indian actors collected from more than 100 videos. All the images are manually selected and cropped from the video frames resulting in a high degree of variability in terms of scale, pose, expression, illumination, age, resolution, occlusion, and makeup. This dataset can be used for Face Recognition.

**Prerequisite**:
Knowledge of face recognition algorithms and techniques would be beneficial for using this dataset.

**License**:
Taken From Kaggle. It's recommended to check the official source or contact the authors for accurate licensing information.

**Additional Information**:
IMFDB is the first face database that provides a detailed annotation of every image in terms of age, pose, gender, expression and type of occlusion that may help other face related applications. This dataset is modified in such a way that it is ready for training a Face Recognition model.
